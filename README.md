A comprehensive analysis of the CORD-19 COVID-19 research dataset with an interactive web application for exploring publication trends, journal statistics, and research themes.

## 📋 Project Overview

This project fulfills the Python Frameworks Assignment requirements by implementing:

- **Data Loading & Exploration**: Importing and examining the CORD-19 metadata
- **Data Cleaning & Preparation**: Handling missing values and formatting issues
- **Data Analysis & Visualization**: Extracting insights and creating visual representations
- **Interactive Web Application**: Building a Streamlit app for data exploration
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive reporting of methodology and findings

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- CORD-19 metadata.csv file from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Frameworks_Assignment.git
   cd Frameworks_Assignment
   ```

2. **Download the dataset**
   - Visit [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge)
   - Download `metadata.csv`
   - Place it in the `data/` directory

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

**Run the data analysis:**
```bash
python cord19_analysis.py
```

**Launch the web application:**
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
The application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`
